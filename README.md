Block 09 - Project 1

Portfolio Project #1

Made Main, Master, About, and Portfolio Branches

Practiced CSS, but still have a ton of question about customizing / design

I feel much more comfortable now overall and was very excited to accomplish this project

Home Page was a breeze

About Page was pretty easy, but I need to learn how to center photos / create borders or lines to seperate parts of the page
